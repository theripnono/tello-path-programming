# Yolov5 in a Tello  

This repository consists of two main things:

>A Yolov5 model for detecting objects using a drone. When an object is detected, it takes a picture and stores it. 
>For this model a Mature and Inmature Orange detecion model was trained using Roboflow framework. link: https://roboflow.com/
  
> An A-Star algorithm used for path-finding and graph traversals. 

### Motivation

This was my master's thesis, where I wanted to make an orange detector on a drone so that the farmer could check his crop, whether he could harvest or not. It also uses the A-star algorithm to show the shortest route with the most oranges to optimise the harvest.

### Prerequisites
  
  For a good performence it is recommended to have a gpu to run the model e.g: Geforce RTX3050

### Installing

  Clone the repository and run the main file. Change the directory path where the images are stored.
