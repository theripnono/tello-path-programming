# Yolov5 in a Tello  

This repository consists of two main things:
  A Yolov5 model for detecting objects using a drone. When an object is detected, it takes a picture and stores it. My model is trained to find Mature an Inmature Oranges.
  
  An algorithm to start on a grid to find the optimal path between two points

### Prerequisites
  
  For a good performence it is recommended to have a gpu to run the model e.g: Geforce RTX3050

### Installing

  Clone the repository and run the main file. Change the directory path where the images are stored.
